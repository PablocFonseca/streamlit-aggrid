**AgGrid** is an awesome grid for web frontend. More information in [https://www.ag-grid.com/](https://www.ag-grid.com/). Consider purchasing a license from Ag-Grid if you are going to use enterprise features!

Current AgGrid version is [32.3.0](https://www.ag-grid.com/archive/32.3.0/)

# Install

```
pip install streamlit-aggrid

```

# Quick Use

Create an example.py file

```python
from st_aggrid import AgGrid
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/airline-safety/airline-safety.csv')
AgGrid(df)
```

Run :

```shell
streamlit run example.py
```

# Demo

Grid data is sent back to streamlit and can be reused in other components. In the example below a chart is updated on grid edition.

# Development Notes

Version 1.1.0

- Updated AgGrid to version 32.3
- Added partial support for the aggrid [Theming](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/theming/) - Check [example](https://staggrid-examples.streamlit.app/Themes)
- Cleaned project dependencies (Altair < 5)

Version 1.0.5

- Updated AgGrid to version 31.3

Version 1.0.4

- Added information on the event that triggered app rerun

Version 1.0.2

- Moved a lot of response processment to python side.
- Changed grid return object.

> [!WARNING]
> v1.0.0 breaks compatibility with previous versions and many people reached me to say that it is unstable.  
> Main changes are on gridReturn object as I'm moving heavy processment to python side.  
> I'm working to stabilize it, if you find any issues, please open a topic on the issue tracker  
> with a reproductile example, if possible.  
> Meanwhile use the last v.0.3.4 if things are not working for you! I hope to have everything fixed soon.

Version 0.3.5

Version 0.3.4

- Added quickfilter
- Added Excel Export Module
- Bugfixes (an probably introduced new ones :/)
- Code cleanup
- Updated Ag-Grit to 29.1.0 (including ag-grid-react) which will cause direct HTML returns to stop rendering ([#198](https://github.com/PablocFonseca/streamlit-aggrid/issues/198)). Use a [cellRenderer](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/component-cell-renderer/) instead.

Version 0.3.3

Version 0.3.0

- Merged some PR (Thanks everybody!) check PR at github!
- Added class parsing in React Side, so more advanced CellRenderers can be used. (Thanks [kjakaitis](https://github.com/kjakaitis))
- Added gridOptionsBuilder.configure_first_column_as_index() to, well, style the first columns as an index (MultiIndex to come!)
- Improved serialization performance by using simpler pandas to_json method (PR #62, #85)
- Added option to render plain json instead of pd.dataframes
- gridOptions may be loaded from file paths or strings
- gridReturn is now a @dataclass with rowIndex added to selected_rows, (previous version returned only the selected data, now you can know which row was selected)
- Changed GridReturnMode behavior. Now update_on accepts a list of gridEvents that will trigger a streamlit refresh, making it possible to subscribe to any [gridEvent](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/grid-events/).
