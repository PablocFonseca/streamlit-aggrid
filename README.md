# Install
```
pip install streamlit-aggrid

```

# Quick Use
Create an example.py file
```python
from st_aggrid import AgGrid
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/airline-safety/airline-safety.csv')
AgGrid(df)
```

# Development Notes
Version 0.3.0  
* Merged some PR (Thanks everybody!) check PR at github!
* Added class parsing in React Side, so more advanced CellRenderers can be used. (Thanks [kjakaitis](https://github.com/kjakaitis))
* Added gridOptionsBuilder.configure_first_column_as_index() to, well, style the first columns as an index (MultiIndex to come!)
* Improved serialization performance by using simpler pandas to_json method (PR #62, #85)
* Added option to render plain json instead of pd.dataframes
* gridOptions may be loaded from file paths or strings
* gridReturn is now a @dataclass with rowIndex added to selected_rows, (previous version returned only the selected data, now you can know which row was selected)
* Changed GridReturnMode behaviour. Now update_on accepts a list of gridEvents that will trigger a streamlit refresh, making it possible to subscribe to any [gridEvent](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/grid-events/).
* Removed dot-env and simplejson dependencies.
* Other smaller fixes and typos corrections.


Version 0.2.3
* small fixes
* Merged PR #44 and #25 (thanks [msabramo](https://github.com/msabramo) and [ljnsn](https://github.com/ljnsn))
* Merged PR #58 - allow nesting dataframes. Included an example in exampes folder.

Version 0.2.2
* Updated frontend dependencies to latest version
* Corrected text color for better viz when using streamlit theme (thanks [jasonpmcculloch](https://github.com/jasonpmcculloch))
* Switched default theme to Balham Light ('light'), if you want to use streamlit theme set `theme='streamlit'` on agGrid call 


Version 0.2.0
* Support Themes
* Incorporated Pull Requests with fixes and pre-select rows (Thanks [randomseed42](https://github.com/randomseed42) and [msabramo](https://github.com/msabramo))
* You can use strings instead of importing GridUpdateMode and DataReturnMode enumerators
* it works fine with st.forms!
* new theme example in example folder

Version 0.1.9
* Small fixes 
* Organized examples folder

Version 0.1.8
* Fixes a bug that breaks the grid when NaN or Inf values are present in the data

Version 0.1.7
* Fixes a bug that happened when converting data back from the grid with only one row
* Added license_key parameter on AgGrid call.

Version 0.1.6
* Fixes issue [#3](https://github.com/PablocFonseca/streamlit-aggrid/issues/3)
* Adds support for timedelta columns check [example][share_link]

Version 0.1.5

* there is an option to avoid grid re-initialization on app update (check fixed_key_example.py on examples folder or [here](https://share.streamlit.io/pablocfonseca/streamlit-aggrid/main/examples/fixed_key_example.py))

Version 0.1.3
* Fixed bug where cell was blank after edition.
* Added enable_enterprise_modules argument to AgGrid call for enabling/disabling [enterprise features](https://www.ag-grid.com/documentation/javascript/licensing/)
* It is now possible to inject js functions on gridOptions. Enabling advanced customizations such as conditional formatting (check 4<sup>th</sup> column on the [example](share_link))

Version 0.1.2
* added customCurrencyFormat as column type

 Version 0.1.0:
* I worked a little bit more on making the example app functional.
* Couple configuration options for update mode (How frontend updates streamlit) and for data returns (grid should return data filtered? Sorted?)
* Some basic level of row selection

* Lacks performance for production. JS Client code is slow...
